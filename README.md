Nowadays every business, every startups, and most of the employees,
freelances own websites. It's maybe commercial or portfolios 
but every website in this world must have a footer. Footer is one of
the important component in a website, it has numerous uses.

### First let's start with the question that has been asked the most 'What is a footer?'

The website footer is the section of content at the very bottom of 
a web page. It typically contains a copyright notice, link to a 
privacy policy, sitemap, logo, contact information, social media 
icons, and an email sign-up form. In short, a footer contains 
information that improves a website’s overall usability. 

### Benefits of using the footer in your website

#### 1. They emphasize your content


Making your footer visible will attract a larger number of visitors to them. You can hardly imagine how long readers can scroll down your page – close to infinity! Remember: you footer is never too far, so it will apparently find its audience. 

#### 2. They help you win leads


Let your visitors know that the bottom of a page is not the end of a website. It may be a time to leave your website but not your company. Pick what fits you better: either contact form, email, or address in the footer will help your users take the next step.

#### 3. They provide your users with useful info


Got more information than can be adequately put into a single page? Place it in your footer! It concerns any links to external resources, your partners, sponsors. Putting some legal info into your website may also be reasonable, but terms of service or legal notice are always better off somewhere underneath.

#### 4. They guide your readers


If your website visitors find themselves too far from the header – it is an unmistakable sign that they are still in search of something they came for. Navigate them through your footer to the main sections of your website.

#### 5. They hold visitors’ attention


If basic information on your website supposes meager information, you can catch the attention by final accord making your website footer design creative or even entertaining.
